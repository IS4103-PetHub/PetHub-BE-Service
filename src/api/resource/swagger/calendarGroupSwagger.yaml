  /api/calendar-groups/available-timeslots/{calendarID}:
    get:
      summary: Get available time slots for a given calendar ID.
      description: |
        Retrieve a list of available time slots based on a calendar's configurations. The endpoint calculates sub-slots 
        of size equal to the desired `duration` provided in the query. For each sub-slot, it verifies if there are 
        available vacancies by accounting for any overlapping bookings within the main timeslot.

        It's important to note that the endpoint will return every sub-slot of the desired duration that has a 
        positive number of vacancies. This means that even if two or more of these sub-slots could potentially be 
        combined into a larger available slot, they will be presented individually. For instance, if you ask for 
        15-minute sub-slots within an hour that has vacancies for the entire duration, you would get four individual 
        15-minute slots instead of a single 1-hour slot.
